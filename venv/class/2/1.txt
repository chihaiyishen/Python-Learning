Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) 
Why Integrity Matters
What is Integrity?
　　The key to integrity is consistency--not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each day. One who has integrity is bound by and follows moral and ethical standards even when making life's hard choices, choices which may be clouded by stress, pressure to succeed, or temptation.
　　What happens if we lie, cheat, steal, or violate other ethical standards? We feel disappointed in ourselves and ashamed. But a lapse of integrity also affects our relationships with others. Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus, integrity must be one of our most important goals.
Risky Business
　　We are each responsible for our own decisions, even if the decision-making process has been undermined by stress or peer pressure. The real test of character is whether we can learn from our mistake, by understanding why we acted as we did, and then exploring ways to avoid similar problems in the future.
　　Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can't see the risks we're taking, we can't make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn't know the rules about plagiarism may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit, or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is "unintentional" does not excuse the misconduct. Ignorance is not a defense.
"But Everybody Does It"
　　Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts, but manage to fool themselves about the risks they're taking by using excuses: "Everyone else does it," "I'm not hurting anyone,” or "I really need this grade." Excuses can get very elaborate: "I know I'm looking at another's exam, even though I'm supposed to keep my eyes on my own paper, but that's not cheating because I'm just checking my answers, not copying." We must be honest about our actions, and avoid excuses. If we fool ourselves into believing we're not doing anything wrong, we can't see the real choice we're making--and that leads to bad decisions.
　　To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public and anyone could be watching over your shoulder. Would you feel proud or ashamed of your actions? If you'd rather hide your actions, that's a good indication that you're taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.
Evaluating Risks
　　To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immediate benefits ("what's in it for me"), and simply haven't considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious, and may include a "0" on a test or assignment; an "F" in the class; suspension or dismissal from school; transcript notation; and a tarnished reputation. In fact, when you break a rule or law, you lose control over your life, and give others the power to impose punishment: you have no control over what that punishment might be. This is an extremely precarious and vulnerable position. There may be some matters of life and death, or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren't many things that fall in this category.
Getting Away With It--Or Not
　　Those who don't get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn't learn from the test, depriving him/herself of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence: the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self-esteem and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty, and afraid of getting caught. Worst of all, a cheater who doesn't get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems "easier." This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences. Students have been dismissed from school because they didn't get this simple message: Honesty is the ONLY policy that works.
Cheating Hurts Others, Too
　　Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions "don't count" and don't really hurt anyone. But individual choices have a profound cumulative effect. Cheating can spread like a disease, and a cheater can encourage others just by being seen from across the room. Recent statistics suggest 30% or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others' grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating "poisons" the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. ("If I don't cheat, I can't compete with those who do.") Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of good teaching is seeing students learn, but a cheater says, "I'm not interested in what you're trying to teach; all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others." The end result is a blatant and destructive attack on the quality of your education. Finally, cheating can hurt the reputation of the University, and harm those who worked hard for their degree.
Why Integrity Matters
　　If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others every day. If not, we couldn't put money in the bank, buy food, clothing, or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist--the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation's economy and our individual well-being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.
　　In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society. Our actions do matter. It is essential that we act with integrity in order to build the kind of world in which we want to live.

Passage One 
　　Boys' schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and are more likely to get involved in activities such as art, dance and music, according to research released today.
　　Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity in which students either sink or swim, the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to conform to a stereotype, the US study says.
　　　Boys at single sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to conform to the "boy code" of hiding their emotions to be a "real man".
   The findings of the study go against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.
　　　Tony Little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.
　　The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.
　　But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys' learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia.
　　Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with specifically "boy-focused" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them. Because boys generally have more acute vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given "hands-on" lessons where they are allowed to walk around. "Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modern genre in which violence and sexism are major themes," James wrote.
　　Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to conform to a stereotype that men should be "masterful and in charge" in relationships. "In mixed schools, boys feel compelled to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means," the study reported. 

57. The author believes that a single-sex school would _____________________.
   	A force boys to hide their emotions to be “real man”
　	B help to cultivate masculine aggressiveness in boys 
	C encourage boys to express their emotions more freely 
	D naturally reinforce in boys that traditional image of a man
58. It is commonly believed that in a mixed schools boys ____________________.
　　A perform relatively better 			B grow up more healthily 
	C behave more responsibly 			D receive a better education 
59. What does Tony Little say about the British education system?
　　A It fails more boys than girls academically 	  B It focuses more on mixed school education 
	C It fails to give boys the attention they need 
	D It places more pressure on boys than on girls 
60. According to Abigail James, one of the advantages of single-sex schools is ______________.
　　A teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys 
	B boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted 
	C boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in 
	D teaching can be designed to promote boys’ team spirit  
61. Which of the following is characteristic of boys according to Abigail James’ report? 
　　A They enjoy being in charge 		B They conform to stereotypes 
	C They have sharper vision 			D They are violent and sexist 
Passage Two 
　　　It's an annual argument. Do we or do we not go on holiday? My partner says no because the boiler could go, or the roof fall off, and we have no savings to save us. I say that you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday. The joy of a recession means no argument next year C we just won't go.
　　　Since money is known to be one of the things most likely to bring a relationship to its knees, we should be grateful. For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday. A YouGov poll of 2,000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money. What's less clear is whether divorce and separation rates rise in a recession C financial pressures mean couples argue more but make splitting up less affordable. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples. Disputes were characterized by intense verbal aggression, tended to be repeated and not resolved, and made men, more than women, extremely angry.
　　　Kim Stephenson, an occupational psychologist, believes money is such a big deal because of what it symbolizes, which may be different things to men and women. "People can say the same things about money but have different conceptions of what it is for," he explains. "They will say it's to save, to spend, for security, for freedom, to show someone you love them" He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something. 
　　　"The biggest problem is that couples assume each other knows what is going on with their finances, but they don't. There seems to be more of a taboo about talking about money than talking about death. But you both need to know what you are doing, who is paying what into the joint account and how much you keep separately. In a healthy relationship you don't have to agree about money, but you have to talk about it."

62. What does the author say about vacationing? 
　　A People enjoy it all the more during a recession 
	B Few people can afford it without working hard
	C It makes all the hard work worthwhile  
	D It is the chief cause of family disputes
63. What does the author mean by saying “money is known… to bring a relationship to its knees” (Line1 Para. 2)？
　　A Money is considered to be the root of all evils
	B Some people sacrifice their dignity for money 
	C Few people can resist the temptation of money 
	D Disputes over money may ruin a relationship 
64. The YouGov poll of 2000 people indicates that in a recession _________________.
　　A conflicts between couples tend to rise 
	B it is more expensive for couples to split up
	C couples show more concern for each other  
	D divorce and separation rates increase 
65. What does Kim Stephenson believe?
　　A Money is often a symbol of a person’s status 
	B Money means a great deal to both men and women 
	C Men and women spend money on different things  
	D Men and women view money in different ways 
66. The author suggests at the end of the passage that couples should ________________
　　A put their money together instead of keeping it separately 
	B make efforts to reach agreement on their family budgets
	C discuss money matters to maintain a healthy relationship 
	D avoid arguing about money matters to remain romantic

　　　【标准版】Nothing Succeeds Without a Strong Will
　　　Nothing runs smoothly in our life. To achieve things successfully, a strong will is essential. Life is like a Marathon. Many people can’t get to the terminal. This is not because they are lack of vitality but because their will of success is not strong enough.
　　　To take quitting smoking as an example, some regard it as a piece of cake. They make up their minds to quit it in the morning, but in the evening they feel that the smell of cigarettes is tempting. Their throats are sore, their mouths are thirsty, and their hands are shaking. After the painful mental struggle, they tell themselves that “One cigarette is enough. Just take one, and the next day I will quit it.” By doing this, they surrender to their weak will. In the end, they have quitted smoking “a hundred times”, but in no time they succeed.
　　　Just like quitting smoking, nothing succeeds without a strong will. To be successful in one’s life, a strong will means that you know where you go and you will persist on the road you choose. Undoubtedly success belongs to those who overcome their weak will and who hang in there until the last minute.
　　　【高分版】Nothing Succeeds Without a Strong Will
　　　As we have read from above, quitting-smoking seems easy, but in reality it is rarely achieved. There is something provoking and interesting in this paradox, just because sword does not wear the stone as dripping water does.
　　　The ability to do something over and over again in a short time may imply its easiness, but in a long run, a lifetime maybe, things turn out to be quite the opposite. Also, as is often the case, one may have obtained all the tools and opportunities to achieve something, but in the end they still fail due to the will shortage.
　　　So how could we avoid the dilemma? Here is the prime condition of success: will and perseverance. Concentrate you energy, thought and mind exclusively on the business in which you are engaged, hang on in there and be patient, for, as Emerson put it, no one can cheat you out of your ultimate success but yourself.

　　【文章点评】
　　本文属于话题类作文，只看题目 “Nothing Succeeds without a strong will”考生会觉得比较抽象，难以下手。细看题目说明中给出了提示，要求考生结合戒烟屡次不成功的幽默引语对该话题进行分析阐述。
　　总体来说，这是一篇“中等偏上”的考生作文。本文先点题指出“坚强意志”的重要性；第二段从反面举例阐述――具体描写了意志不坚定者的心理活动，阐述为什么会戒烟失败；最后从戒烟延伸到生活中的其他事情，并复述坚强意志的内涵，点题收尾。
　　总体上来看，文章思路清晰，采用了生动的比喻和形象的心理描写，语言流畅，用语地道。但一些重复表达（如第二段和第三段中的weak will）显得单调，可用shaky ones, weak-willed persons，the strong-willed等灵活表达。在备考中，多积累不同表达，相信会写出更生动的文章。
　　在论述上，叙述略显罗嗦。第二段心理描写过多，虽然流畅生动，但却使这篇考场作文超过了规定字数，反而成为失分点，这一点要引以为戒。

　　本次四级作文探讨的话题是成功与毅力之间的关系，话题不算新，一般考生对此都比较熟悉，所以对考生来说难度不大。写好这篇作文，需要抓住两点，一是紧跟题目要求，即对上述幽默性的话语做出评论，二是在评论的基础上要亮出自己的观点。
　　范文开头第一句即一针见血地对上述幽默性话语做出总结性概括，即戒烟看似简单实则很难，随后指出该话语本质上是一个悖论，并且以一个“水滴石穿”的俗语来指出困难所在，这句也是本文的一个亮点，体现作者在西方俗语方面丰富的知识储备。
　　第二段作者则进一步深入分析该话语，指出做某事在短期看来很容易，长期来看，恰恰相反，人们做事的结果也因此总是失败，原因则在最后一句点出：缺乏毅力。
　　第三段作者进一步给出了自己的观点，告诉大家如何避免陷入这种两难境地：首要条件即需要坚强的意志和长期的坚持。最后再以艾默生的一句名言 “没人能够骗你远离你最终的成功，除非你自己承认失败”来总结全文，切中主题，铿锵有力。

　　W: Oh, yes, but I wish I could have stayed awake long enough to see the whole thing.
　　Q: What does the man mean?
　　【答案】A) He fell asleep in the middle of the TV program.
　　【解析】这是道推理判断题，考查男士的言下之意以及虚拟语气。could have done意为本可以做某事，但未做。从对话中可知，男士确实回家看了电视节目，但是他说道：I wish I could have stayed awake long enough to see the whole thing. 我真希望自己当时能再晚点睡着，这样我就可以看完整场节目了。说明他没有看完整场节目就睡着了。
　　13.

　　M: Sure, but there is a lot of traffic everywhere today because of the football game.
　　Q: What do we learn about the woman from the conversation?
　　【答案】B) She is worried about missing her flight.
　　【解析】这是道场景题，略有难度。刚开始，我们还无法很快判断出该对话发生的场景，很多同学一听到airport可能会误以为对话发生在机场，但如果我们继续听下去，就会发现，该对话应该发生在出租车上，因为女士说了句“请选择最快的路”，而男士说“因为有球赛，所以到处都交通拥堵”可以帮助我们再次确认对话发生的场景。选项A不对，原文是说要挑the fastest way哪怕不是the most direct way；选项C也不准确，才刚上车，并没有拥堵，司机只是提前说明因为球赛会碰到拥堵；选项D错误，女士是为了赶去乘飞机的，而不是去看球赛。
　　14.

　　Section B
　　Passage One
　　While Gail Obcamp, an American artist was giving a speech on the art of Japanese brush painting to an audience that included visitors from Japan, she was confused to see that many of her Japanese listeners have their eyes closed. Were they tuned off because an American had the nerve to instruct Japanese in their own art form? Were they deliberately tried to signal their rejection of her? Obcamp later found out that her listeners were not being disrespectful. Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes to enhance concentration. Her listeners were showing their respect for her by chewing on her words. Some day you may be either a speaker or a listener in a situation involving people from other countries or members of a minority group in North America. Learning how different cultures signal respect can help you avoid misunderstandings. Here are some examples. In the deaf culture of North America, Many listeners show applause not by clapping their hands but by waving them in the air. In some cultures, both overseas and in some minority groups in North America, listeners are considered disrespectful if they look directly at the speaker. Respect is shown by looking in the general direction but avoiding direct eye contact. In some countries, whistling by listeners is a sign of approval while in other courtiers it is a form of insult.
　　【听力点睛】本文主要介绍不同文化中都是如何表示尊重的，以及如何利用这点来避免跨文化交流中的误会产生。一开始先用一位美国艺术家Gail Obcamp做演讲的故事来举例子，引出对闭上眼睛这样一种动作不同的理解；继而发表了作者的看法：在和不同文化的人交流的时候，如果你懂得其他文化中是如何表达尊重的，可以避免误会；接着又是例子，是关于北美洲聋哑人是如何用动作来交流的。还有一些国家，对同样的手势会有截然不同的理解，进一步验证了作者的观点。
　　做这篇题目的重点在于能够迅速拎出来作者的观点。

Passage Two
　　Chris is in charge of purchasing and maintaining equipment in his Division at Taxlong Company. He is soon going to have an evaluation interview with his supervisor and the personnel director to discuss the work he has done in the past year. Salary, promotion and plans for the coming year will also be discussed at the meeting. Chris has made several changes for his Division in the past year. First, he bought new equipment for one of the departments. He has been particularly happy about the new equipment because many of the employees have told him how much it has helped them. Along with improving the equipment, Chris began a program to train employees to use equipment better and do simple maintenance themselves. The training saved time for the employees and money for the company. Unfortunately, one serious problem developed during the year. Two employees that Chris hired were stealing, and he had to fire them. Chris knows that a new job for a purchasing and maintenance manager for the whole company will be open in a few months, and he would like to be promoted to the job. Chris knows, however, that someone else wants that new job, too. Kim is in charge of purchasing and maintenance in another Division of the company. She has also made several changes over the year. Chris knows that his boss likes Kim’s work, and he expects that his work will be compared with hers.

　　Passage Three
　　Proverbs, sometimes called sayings, are examples of folk wisdom. They are little lessons which older people of a culture pass down to the younger people to teach them about life. Many proverbs remind people of the values that are important in the culture. Values teach people how to act, what is right, and what is wrong. Because the values of each culture are different, understanding the values of another culture helps explain how people think and act. Understanding your own culture values is important too. If you can accept that people from other cultures act according to their values, not yours, getting along with them will be much easier. Many proverbs are very old. So some of the values they teach may not be as important in the culture as they once were. For example, Americans today do not pay much attention to the proverb “Haste makes waste”, because patience is not important to them. But if you know about past values, it helps you to understand the present and many of the older values are still strong today. Benjamin Franklin, a famous American diplomat, writer and scientist, died in 1790, but his proverb “Time is money” is taken more seriously by Americans of today than ever before. A study of proverbs from around the world shows that some values are shared by many cultures. In many cases though, the same idea is expressed differently.
　　【听力点睛】这篇文章是一篇说明文。从科学客观的角度讲述了Proverb谚语的一些知识。包括它的定义-----是老一辈人传给后代的生活经验，生活价值观。不同国家，不同文化中的谚语往往可以揭示不同的价值观。如果能够理解其他文化的谚语，价值观，那么会在跨文化交际中避免很多麻烦。
　　作者又提到，一些谚语年代久远。其中包含的价值观随着时代的变迁可能重要性也发生了改变。并且举了Haste makes waste. 和Time is money. 这样两个例子。
　　作者最后再次表明，通过学习不同国家的谚语，会发现一些国家会有相同或者相似的价值观，只是有可能表达的方式有所不同而已。
　　这篇说明文对考生的要求在于快速划分出作者想说明的几个点。一般通常写说明文章的顺序都是先说明要点，然后用一些事实来进一步说明。
　　Questions 32- 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
　　33. Why are proverbs so important?
　　A) They help us see the important values of a culture.
　　B) They guide us in handling human relationships.
　　C) They help us express ourselves more effectively.
　　D) They are an infinite source of human knowledge.
　　【答案】A）They help us see the important values of a culture.
　　34. According to the speaker what happens to some proverbs with the passage of time?
　　A)Their wordings may become different.
　　B) The values they reflect may change.
　　C)Their origins can no longer be traced.

　　Employers fear they will be unable recruit students with the skills they need as the economic recovery kicks in, a new survey 67.reveals.
　　Nearly half of organizations told researchers they were already struggling to find 68.staffwith skills in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), 69.while even more companies expect to experience 70.shortages of employees with Stem skills in the next three years.
　　The Confederation of British Industry and the vocational qualifications body EDI 71.surveyed 694 organizations across the public and 72.private sectors, which together employ 2.4 million people.
　　Half are 73.concerned they will not be able to fill graduate posts in the coming years, while a third said they would not be able to 74.recruit enough employees with the right A-level skills.
　　"75.As we move further into recovery and businesses plan 76.for growth, the demand for people with high-quality skills and qualifications will 77.intensify," said Richard Lambert, director general, CBI.
　　"In the future, people with qualifications in science and maths will be particularly sought after, and firms say it is already hard to find people with the right 78.technical or engineering skills. The new government must make it a top 79.priority to encourage more young people to study science-related 80.subjects."
　　The survey found that young people would improve their job prospects 81.if they studied business studies, maths, English and physics or chemistry at A-level. The A-levels that employers 82.rate least are psychology and sociology. And while many employers don't insist on a 83.particular degree subject, a third prefer to hire those with a Stem-related subject.
　　The research 84.highlighted worries about the lack of progress in improving basic skills in the UK 85.workforce. Half of employers expressed worries about employees' basic literacy and numeracy skills, while the biggest problem is with IT skills, 86.where two-thirds reported concerns.
　　【评析】这是一篇讨论“雇主和他们所需要的大学生技能” 的文章。今年四级的完型填空，涉及5处名词，2处介词，6处动词，4处形容词和3处副词。第82题稍难，像80和85都可以通过上下文判断出来，其余部分只要在句子内部或者句子之间进行上下文逻辑比对或语法搭配，即可完成。词义辨析考查较多，考查学生词汇的储备量，因此，考生要特别注意四级词汇的牢固掌握。

　　67.
　　【答案】reveals
　　【解析】第一段提出话题，“据一项最新调查显示，现在的雇主们害怕他们雇不到符合要求的毕业生”，launch意思为“发起一场运动”，submit意为“提交，服从”，generate生成，reveal透露，揭露，显示。这里根据段意，reveal最合适。
68.
　　【答案】staff
　　【解析】根据句意，基本有一半的组织机构告诉调查者他们在努力寻找具有四个方面（科学、技术、工程和数学）才能的职员。这里partners，audience, officials显然不符合题意。
　　69.
　　【答案】while
　　【解析】这里和前面已经叙述的事实构成并列，“同时，更多公司预测，接下来的三年他们都将会遭遇雇员四缺现象（科学、技术、工程和数学知识技能欠缺）”，因此排除其他三项。选while。
　　70.
　　【答案】shortages
　　【解析】由第二段句首struggling可判断，机构组织寻找这些人才非常不易，那么这种人才显然是不够的，短缺的。absence是表示“缺席，不在”，不能描述短缺，因此排除。此题的另一个关键是确定experience的词性，动词。
　　71.
　　【答案】surveyed
　　【解析】第三段用一句话简介经过工业联盟调查了69个行业和组织，首先排除D和C，search是指搜查；细查某处以搜寻某人或某物，搜索；而survey是指调查某部分人的行为、意见等（通常以询问方式进行），符合题意。
　　72.
　　【答案】private
　　【解析】根据上一题的意思，调查在公共和私人部门中展开，后面一句的together暗示and后面的这个空是和“公共的”对立的，因此填private。
　　73.
　　【答案】concerned
　　【解析】第四段描写了这个调查的具体情况。有一半人…，这里缺少动词，confront一般和with连用，conform 符合，遵照，confuse 使混乱，使困惑，这里根据上下文的意思，雇主们都担心这种现象的发生，因此选concerned, be concerned 担心的，烦恼的，忧虑的。
　　74.
　　【答案】recruit
　　【解析】本题考查词义辨析，三分之一的被调查者坦言他们可能顾不到符合相应资质的雇员，只有recruit符合题意。
　　75.
　　【答案】As
　　【解析】根据句子结构判断，前半句是一个伴随状语，“随着…的深入进行，…需求越来越强”，而不是条件状语或让步状语。
76.
　　【答案】for
　　【解析】这里考查介词搭配。这里侧重于描述执行进展的计划的目的，选for。
　　77.
　　【答案】intensify
　　【解析】本题考查词义辨析。根据前文，这种需求是不断增加的，intensify 增强，强化，变激烈；dominate指在…中占主导地位，这里并没有给出一个具体的范围，不符合句意。enforce 实施，执行；stretch 伸展。
　　78.
　　【答案】technical
　　【解析】本题比较简单，属于送分题。前卖第二段已经指出在四个方面技能欠缺，选项中显然只有technical符合文意。
　　79.

　　Section B
　　Passage One
　　57, C encourage boys to express their emotions freely
　　58, A perform relatively better
　　59, C It fails to give boys the attention they need
　　60, A teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys
　　61, C They have sharper vision
　　【解析】这篇文章针对传统的男女生一起上学，一起接受教育提出了质疑。作者从文章一开头就表明了自己的看法：对于男生而言，单性教育，即男生们一起上学会对男生的身心发展更为有利。文中出现一个短语，received wisdom，即是“人们普遍的看法，公认的看法”。也是作者所批判的一种观点。传统观点认为，男生和女生混合教育会对男生发展更有利。
　　但是作者认为单性教育对男生有以下几个好处：可以让男生们更自由地表达自己的情感，可以学习自己感兴趣的艺术，舞蹈，音乐等学科。不用去遵守人们在传统印象中对男生的期盼。而且单性教育可以针对男生的身心发展特点而制定学习计划。
　　并且作者觉得，目前英国教育把女生当做关注重点，忽视了对男生的重视。
　　Passage Two
　　62. C . It makes all the hard work worthwhile.
　　63. D. Disputes over money may ruin a relationship.
　　64. A. conflicts between couples tend to rise
　　65. D. men and women view money in different ways.
　　66. C. discuss money matters to maintain a healthy relationship.
　　【解析】这是一篇关于金钱对夫妻关系的影响的文章。文中第一段主要通过度假这件事来体现不同人对待金钱的不同态度。作者认为人只能活一次，如果不能去度假的话，那么工作再努力也没有意义。第二段主要谈到了大萧条时期，不太良好的经济状况常常会影响夫妻关系，可能会导致争吵，甚至会导致离婚或者分居的成本增加，对夫妻感情造成伤害。第三段讲了Kim Stephenson，一个心理学家的观点，即男人和女人对待金钱的态度是不一样的，男人把金钱看作是得到社会地位的途径，看作向父母展现自己成功的一种方式。第四段，作者建议夫妻可以对金钱持有不同的观点，但是不可以对它采取回避的态度，避而不谈。
　　相对来说，这篇文章的难度比较大。文章看懂并不难，但是题目中，推理题和大意题比较多，需要在充分理解作者意图，了解文章主旨的基础上，才能选出正确答案。
　　Part VI Translation
　　87. Charity groups organized various activities to raise money for the survivors of the earthquake. (为地震幸存者筹款)
　　【解析】本题考察动词raise的用法。raise money 表示“筹款”。同时考生要注意survivor （幸存者）的拼写。
　　88. Linda couldn’t have received my e-mail (不可能收到我的电子邮件), otherwise, she could have replied.
　　【解析】本题考察混合型虚拟语气。otherwise提示我们句子后半句是与过去事实相反（事实是Linda没有回复），因此用could+have+过去分词。句子前半句是在陈述一种事实，从句子后半句could have +过去分词我们可以推断前面“没有收到我的电子邮件”也是在发生在过去，且对现在产生了影响（还没有收到回信），因此这里用现在完成时，could have +过去分词。
　　89. It’s my mother who/that keeps encouraging me not to lose heart (一直鼓励我不要灰心) when I have difficulties in my study.
　　【解析】本题考察了强调句型和动词encourage的搭配。①强调句型it’s … that/who… ②encourage sb. (not) to do sth. 鼓励某人（不）做某事。
　　90. The publishing house has to consider the popularity of this novel. (考虑这本小说的受欢迎程度)。
　　【解析】本题考察了“考虑”的表达，可以用动词consider，也可以用词组take… into consideration。同时考生要注意名词popularity (受欢迎程度) 的拼写。
　　91. It’s wrong to define happiness only by money.(仅仅以金钱来定义幸福)
　　【解析】本题考察了“定义”的表达，为define。
